# Note Taking App

Tech challenge for Firemark's

## How to run

- make sure you are on the root of the project
- install the dependencies with `yarn install` or `npm install`
- run the development server: `yarn dev` or `npm run dev`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.


## Build for production
- run `yarn build` or `npm run build`


## Testing
Since Cypress is testing a real Next.js application, it requires the Next.js server to be running prior to starting Cypress. We recommend running your tests against your production code to more closely resemble how your application will behave.

- Build your code for production
- run `yarn start` or `npm run start`
- run `yarn cypress` or `npm run cypress`
